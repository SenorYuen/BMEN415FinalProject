# **Project Setup**

1. Create a conda environment, something like:
  ```bash
  conda create --name BMEN415 python=3.10
  ```

2. Clone the repo

3. Navigate to it using conda prompt (search for this in your windows menu) and type the following commands:
   ```bash
   conda activate BMEN415
   ```
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Open the project in VSCode and selet any of the python notebooks. Select kernel (top right) and set it to the BMEN415 one we just made.

5. Select Run All (top left-ish). You will need to install the jupyter notebook extension to do this.

6. Hopefully it doesn't crash.
